box2d-image-drop
================
This project uses box2d within a canvas element. After adding 9 image locations to an array, the program reads them to initialize the box elements and also to set the source. The result is 9 images that fall and you can drag around.

Much help from Pascal Rettig's tutorial from http://buildnewgames.com/box2dweb/
